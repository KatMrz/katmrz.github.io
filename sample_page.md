## Cloud Watermelon Code

**Project description:** I first drew my watermelon when I was learning the basics of Javascript, only knowing basic shapes such as ellipse, rect, and triangle. As I learned more principles, I turned my watermelon into a function, added clouds as objects, and animated it all! Here's the first version of Cloud Watermelon, first made in September 2021.
