## Cloud Watermelon

## September 21st, 2021

<p>I started this project when I was first learning Javascript. The watermelon is comprised of triangles for the fruit, ellipses for the seeds and the plates, and rects for the rinds. When I tried to code a lighter green section to look like the inside of the watermelon shell, I accidentally placed it too far on the left. However, I thought it looked like a cloud and got the idea to take my watermelon off of the plate and into the sky!</p>

<p>As I learned more and more Javascript principles, I applied these skills to my watermelon. I turned my watermelon into a draw function so I could give any coordinates I wanted and the whole watermelon would appear. I created clouds as objects so that I could quickly make more with different attributes. I used true and false statements and variables to animate my watermelon, so that the software would detect when the fruit flew too high and would send it back down. This is the latest version of Cloud Watermelon!</p>
